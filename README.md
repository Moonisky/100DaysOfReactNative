# 100 Days Of React Native
> Learning Facebook's new frameworks React Native for building native apps




Since Facebook has announced [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) as the world-class frameworks by using JaveScript and React, many programmer was excited to learn it. Because the company which I'm interested in is using React Native for developing their apps, so I decided to give it a shot. I hope I can finish this project before May.

In this project, I learned how to:

* Build an Interface with `Text` and `TouchableHighlight`.
* Use `CSS` for styling the components.
* Use functions with Text's attribute `onPress`.
* Build a custom Navigation Bar with `Navigator`.
* Save and update component's apperance and data with `State`.
* Unstand the basic knowledges of the `React Native` iOS app.

Tools: [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [React Native 0.21](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
