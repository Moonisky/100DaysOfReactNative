# 100 Days Of React Native
> Learning Facebook's new frameworks React Native for building native apps



Since Facebook has announced [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) as the world-class frameworks by using JaveScript and React, many programmers were excited to learn it. Because the company which I'm interested in is using React Native for developing their apps, so I decided to give it a shot. I hope to be able to finish this project before May.
