# 100 Days Of React Native
> Learning Facebook's new frameworks React Native for building native apps



Since Facebook has announced [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) as the world-class frameworks by using JaveScript and React, many programmers were excited to learn it. Because the company which I'm interested in is using React Native for developing their apps, so I decided to give it a shot. I hope to be able to finish this project before May.

In this project, I learned how to:

* Build an Interface with `Text` and `TouchableHighlight`.
* Use `CSS` for styling the components.
* Use functions with Text's attribute `onPress`.
* Build a custom Navigation Bar with `Navigator`.
* Save and update component's appearance and data with `State`.
* Understand the basic knowledges of the `React Native` iOS app.

Tools: [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [React Native 0.21](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

New Functionalities: [Text](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text.html#content), [TouchableHightlight](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/touchablehighlight.html#content), [Navigator](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html#content), [Style](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/style.html#content)

In this project, I learned how to:

* Work with multiple actions on one button
* Use Timer for handling continuously counting with `setInterval` and `clearInterval`.

Tools: [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), [React Native 0.21](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

New Functionalities: [Gesture Responder System](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/gesture-responder-system.html#content), [Timers](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/timers.html#content)
